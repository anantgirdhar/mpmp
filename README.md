# Anant's Solutions to Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles

## MPMP 03: Scrabble

### Problem for Submission

How many ways, from the 100 standard scrabble tiles, can you choose
seven which total 46 points?

Clarification: How many distinct scrabble hands
(groups of 7 letters) are there that total exactly 46 points? So order does not
matter and identical letters are indistinguishable.

## MPMP 06: Million Bank Balance Puzzle

### Problem for Submission

A bank is running a competition. You can make **two deposits** (of integer
pounds) on two consecutive days and everyday the bank will add your last two
**balances** together to give you a new balance.

For example: You deposit £10 on day 1 and £20 on day 2. Your balance on day 1
would be £10, day 2 £30, day 3 £40, day 4 £70, and so on.

You can keep the money if you balance eventually equals **one million pounds**
exactly. If more than one person hits a million exactly, the price goes to the
person who took the **longest** to get there.

What must your initial deposits be to ensure that you win the million pounds?
